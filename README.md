# Sivil
I am pleased to introduce Sivil, my very first tweak. Sivil is a very simple spotlight customizer.
With Sivil you are able to: 
 - Customize background blur
 - Customize background color
 - Enable experimental iPad spotlight view
## 
Sivil works on iOS 14. Sivil has not been tested on iOS 13 or below.
